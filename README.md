# File-handling-Multi-threading
This is a java programme which uses file-handling and multi-threading concepts. In this programme, a file has alphabets from a to z in lowercases. We need to create 26 threads for 26 alphabets. Each alphabet will give an output from 1 to 26.
For example, whenever the programme reads 'a' it will correspond to 1, 'b' will give an output 2 and so on.
